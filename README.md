## Overview

The Messaging Relay Client-Server System consists of two primary components:
1. **Client**: The client application connects to the server, sends messages, and receives messages from other connected clients.
2. **Server**: The server acts as a relay, facilitating communication between clients by receiving and forwarding messages.
